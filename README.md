# AssignmentDemo

This assignment requires you to write two methods. 
One method is for converting from Celsius to Farenheit and the other is for converting from Farenheit to Clesius.

Begin by forking this repo. Then implement the two methods in the [TemperatureHelpers class](https://github.com/jth41/AssignmentDemo/blob/master/AssignmentDemo/TemperatureHelpers.cs)

 replace `throw new NotImplementedException();` with your code

    public static class TemperatureHelpers
    {
        public static double ConvertFromCelsiusToFarenheit(double inputDegrees)
        {
            throw new NotImplementedException();
        }

        public static double ConvertFromFarenheitToCelsius(double inputDegrees)
        {
            throw new NotImplementedException();
        }
    }


When you are finished implementing the methods. You can submit your solution to the assignment by submitting a pull request.
